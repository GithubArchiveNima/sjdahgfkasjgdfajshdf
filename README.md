# Week 2 Day 1

Weekend fun:

- Sleeping
- same
- Vallea Lumina


## Test Driven Development

- Ask questions, make sure you're doing the right thing.



## Modules, Mocha + Chai, TDD vs. BDD

### Modules

- Any piece of code in the Node framework.
    - any file
- dependencies
    - require
    - in order for the program to run, we NEED to have X


What does JavaScript have?

- for loops (several flavours)
- conditionals (if statements, switch case)
- functions (bundle up some code with input + output)
- data structures
    - arrays
    - objects
    - Set

```js
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 3]
Math.random()
```

"Standard library"

```js
const getEveryThird = (arr) => {
    // returns an array of every 3rd element in arr
}
```



Make our own NPM module


## TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT

1. You write some tests
2. You write some code to make the tests pass
3. Write some tests to break the code.
4. Back to step 2.
